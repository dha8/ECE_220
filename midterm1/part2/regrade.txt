;NOTE: REGRADE REQUEST
; everything on  this part 2 received full credit, except for implementation of RNG.
; previously, I had written a very detailed algorithm, but couldn't implement it out
; due to lack of time. (debugging pt 1 too long). I have implemented it  now, within a 
; very short period of time. the program is working as intended. please! I need those
; points back..
	
;FROM HERE, 11 LINES OF INSTRUCTIONS WERE ADDED! Sorry I already committed to the orig file..

	ST R7, RNG_SaveR7 ; save R7
	ST R5, RNG_SaveR5 ; save ptr to mmr
	ADD R6, R4, #1	  ; R6 = N+1

;loop through N times
RNG_LOOP	
	ADD R6, R6, #-1 ; loop N times
	BRz RNG_DONE
	JSR LCG
	STR R3, R5, #0 ; store Xn into mmr
	ADD R5, R5, #1 ; increment mmr ptr
	BR RNG_LOOP
RNG_DONE
	LD R7, RNG_SaveR7 ;
	LD R5, RNG_SaveR5
    RET

RNG_SaveR7 .BLKW #1 ;
RNG_SaveR5 .BLKW #1 ; 


REGRADE: Unfortunatelly, I cannot regrade this.
