Code assembles, runs, and halts:  5/5

Main program contains a proper call to IS_VALID:  5/5

All registers that are modified by IS_VALID are restored to their original values on return:  5/5

All registers are properly initialized: 5/5

IS_VALID acquires input string from the keyboard until user hits ENTER key:  10/10

IS_VALID reads characters from the keyboard without using any TRAPs:  10/10

IS_VALID echoes input characters to the display without using any TRAPs:  10/10

IS_VALID uses stack subroutines PUSH and POP and implements the required algorithm: 0/35
+ uses PUSH and POP: +10pts

On exit, IS_VALID returns result in R0:  0/5
- regraded: +5pts

Code uses as few as possible iterative and conditional constructs:  5/5

Subroutine is well-documented (description of functionality, register table, comments, proper source code formatting, etc.): 5/5
