Hi,

I think I did not receive points for the following criteria:

	-IS_VALID uses stack subroutines PUSH and POP and implements the above algorithm
	-On exit, IS_VALID returns result in R0

I have used PUSH and POP, just not getting the correct output.. so out of 35 points, maybe I could get just a bit back. 
Also, I believe that my code does return result in R0; it was just that my calculation of R0 was bugged.

thanks for all your hard work!
