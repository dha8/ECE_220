1. What benefits does unit testing provide over testing a program as a whole?
   -In unit testing, there's less code to look at and thus it is easier to spot
    the problems.

2. Your MPs have been graded by autograders. Do the autograders perform black
   box testing or white box testing? Explain your answer.
   -autograders perform black box testing; it provides the input and see
    if the output is correct. The inner workings of the code are neglected.

3. Describe at least one pessimistic test case for programming problem 1 on
   midterm 1.
   -when the input wasn't intended, like spaces or non-alphabet characters,
    like decimal digits.
4.     float result = my_sin(360.0);
       assert(result == 0.0); // if true, move on.

   The assert in the above code snippet is too strict. Assume the
   specification allows my_sin to be off by at most 0.01. How should the
   assert statement be modified to reflect this? (Hint: You may use the fabs()
   absolute value function.)

	float result = my_sin(360.0);
	assert(fabs(result)<=.01); // makes sure this is true
